        <h3>Closing FanFicFare Web Service</h3>
        <p>Starting Nov 30, Google will only allow me to update the web service if I give them a way to bill me for 'building' the app.
        </p>
        <p>
And once they have a way to bill me, they will charge when the service
goes past the free limit unless manually turned off each time or more
draconian scaling settings are used:
        </p>
        <p>
<i>If you are currently relying on the free tier as a cost control
mechanism, you will need to make a configuration change to maintain
the current behavior. You must set a Cloud Budget Alert and manually
shut off your app, or set the max_instances setting to 1 in app.yaml
to never go above the free tier.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
On Friday Nov 15, 2019, I uploaded the new version with the
<i>max_instances:1</i> setting recommended.  The service has been 'Over
Quota' every time I've looked since then.
        </p>
        <p>
I maintain FanFicFare as a hobby and for my own use.  When I inherited
the project from the original developer (Roman Kirillov), it already
had the web service running on Google App Engine associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
I continued to support the web service in recent years as a legacy for
the users who can't run the CLI or Calibre versions.  But I'm not
interested in spending my money on it, or dealing with the accounting
and possible tax implications of collecting donations to run it.
        </p>
        <p>
I plan to continue maintaining the Calibre Plugin and Python CLI
versions of FanFicFare.  But at this point, I'm shutting down the web
service.

service, please join the conversation at
